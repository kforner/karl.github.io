**Installing Poirot**

Poirot is still under development and can be installed from github using [devtools](http:github.com/hadley/devtools). You will also need to install the development versions of [slidify](http://github.com/ramnathv/slidify) and [slidifyLibraries](http://github.com/ramnathv/slidifyLibraries).
